# LLMArena

This is a magical arena for fighters where two opponents fight to decide who is the best. 

You control one fighter and must help them win by tweaking your character. 

A draw means you also lose.

The goal is to win all fights while using as few of your fighter's lives and **with minimal help** from you.

A winner is decided by LLM (thus the project is named LLMArena and the idea was to explore LLMs as engine, we tried many open models but we use GPT-4 for the demo), so use common sense or try to mess with prompts :smiling_imp:

**We have 14 levels and 99 lives**

Levels:

level 1: a rabbit vs a wolf

...

level 13: Kasparov vs DeepBlue

level 14: seee it yourself!

Leaderboard:

_Marko, Martin & Dante: total characters spent: 1832, lives left: 9_
