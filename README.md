# LLMArena

This is a magical arena for fighters where two opponents fight to decide who is the best. 

You control one fighter and must help them win by tweaking your character. 

A draw means you also lose.

The goal is to win all fights while using as few of your fighter's lives and **with minimal help** from you.

A winner is decided by LLM (this, LLMArena, we tried many open models but we use GPT-4 for the demo), so use common sense or try to mess with prompts.

**We have 13 levels and 99 lives**
